# VRMMORPG project

**Project type:** PC video game project.  
**Brief description:** Development of a cross-platform video game (Windows, Mac and Linux) written without a game engine. For now text-based and solo, the ambition is to make it a VRMMORPG.  
**Technologies:** C.  

*Persistence* is the name of a VRMMORPG project, which means "Virtual Reality Massively Multi Player Role Playing Game". My strategy for its development is to focus on game mechanics instead of graphics, and whereas it is a virtual reality game, which already implies 3D, a big chunk of the game can be developped without any audiovisual aspect, which is why it will remain in text form for a good while. This young project just begun as a "text adventure", that is to say a game where the player acts by entering written commands. Its difference from a classic text adventure is that it offers suggestions when the player is lost, and since this reveals the plot it's usually considered as spoiling the player's enjoyment. The objective not being to really develop a text adventure but to use this genre as a springboard for a virtual reality game, I've allowed myself to make the handling of the game more accessible, which I hope will attract players more easily and therefore increase my chances of receiving critiques so as development happens in the best manner.  

The game understands several commands, can save the ongoing game, and has events. An event example is to have the doors lock up the player inside when they cross the mansion's threshold for the first time. The game also contains a mini-game entitled "[Twenty Squares](https://github.com/TheLycorisRadiata/game_twentysquares)", that I leave you to discover as well as the game itself.  

It plays on a terminal and is available on Windows in 32- and 64-bit, on Mac and on Linux.

I wonder why anyone would want to work on the project at this time, but if you're thinking of contacting me about this: forget it. *Persistence* will need a team at some point, but this is way too soon.
