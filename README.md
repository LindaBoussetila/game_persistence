# Treasure Venture

*Treasure Venture* is a text adventure game. It runs on PC and is cross-platform, meaning that it can run on Windows (64 and 32-bit), on Mac and on Linux. Written in the C programming language, it's available in two versions: CLI and GUI. "CLI" stands for "Command-Line Interface", and is the version which runs in the terminal, whereas "GUI" stands for "Graphics User Interface" and this version opens a window. The GUI is made with GTK4, a C library.

A text adventure game is a game that is interacted with through written commands, and which only displays written text. There is no graphical element.  

This project differs from a classic text adventure in that *Treasure Venture* offers suggestions when the player is lost. Since this reveals the plot, it's usually considered as spoiling the player's enjoyment. Even so, I've allowed myself to make the handling of the game more accessible.  

*Treasure Venture* understands several commands, can save the ongoing game, and has events. An example of event is to have the doors lock up behind the player when they cross the mansion's threshold for the first time. It also contains a mini-game entitled "[Twenty Squares](https://github.com/TheLycorisRadiata/c_game_twentysquares)", that I leave you to discover as well as the game itself.
